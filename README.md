## Overview
The Padelplay website project is designed to offer an intuitive and visually appealing online presence for Padelplay, a company specializing in promoting and facilitating padel sports. This project encompasses a comprehensive solution that includes user research, prototype development, and front-end implementation using modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used
- Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- Sanity.io as a backend for content management, providing a flexible and powerful solution for managing website content.
- TypeScript for adding type safety to the development process, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first CSS, facilitating rapid UI development with responsiveness in mind.
- Additional tools and libraries include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and various Adobe Creative Suite applications for design purposes.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
